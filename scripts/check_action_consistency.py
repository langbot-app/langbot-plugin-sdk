"""Static consistency check for the action-based runtime protocol.

The runtime protocol (``runtime/io/``) dispatches calls by action name: a sender
calls ``call_action(SomeAction.MEMBER, ...)`` and a receiver must have registered
a handler with ``@handler.action(SomeAction.MEMBER)``. If the handler is missing,
the call fails *at runtime* with ``ValueError: Action <name> not found`` — a class
of bug that unit tests miss because they mock the proxy layer, and that only shows
up end-to-end (this is exactly how ``vector_list`` shipped broken: the enum member,
the plugin-side proxy, and a proxy-level test all existed, but no runtime forwarder
was registered).

This checker parses the SDK with ``ast`` (no imports, no side effects) and enforces:

1. ERROR: every action *invoked* in-repo (``call_action`` / ``call_action_generator``
   with a literal ``EnumClass.MEMBER`` argument) has a matching ``.action(...)``
   registration in-repo — UNLESS the action's receiver is an external process
   (the LangBot host), whose handlers live in a different repository. This is the
   invariant ``vector_list`` violated.
2. ERROR: every ``EnumClass.MEMBER`` referenced by an invocation or registration
   actually exists on that enum class (guards against typos / renames).
3. WARN: enum members that are neither invoked nor registered anywhere in-repo —
   candidate dead wiring ("enum without action"). Warning only, because a member
   may legitimately be invoked or handled by the LangBot host (a separate repo).

Action enum classes follow the ``<Sender>To<Receiver>Action`` naming convention.
The *receiver* is what must hold the handler, so Rule 1 only applies when the
receiver lives in this repository (Runtime or Plugin); actions received by the
LangBot host are handled there and cannot be checked from here.

Known, accepted exceptions are listed in ``KNOWN_EXCEPTIONS`` with a reason so the
gate can go green on a branch while pre-existing debt is tracked explicitly rather
than hidden.

Exit code is non-zero if any unexpected ERROR is found. Run from the repo root:
