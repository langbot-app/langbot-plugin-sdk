        The runtime calls this once per installation, after that installation's
        in-flight messages have been cancelled and its slot detached, and before
        anything else may reuse the object graph. Shared placement calls it for
        uninstall, disable, workspace removal and upgrade (the superseded binding
        is revoked when the new revision activates). Dedicated workers are shut
        down instead of detached, so their process-local state disappears with
        the process and this hook is not called.

        Shared-runtime plugins must drop every cache or registry entry keyed by
        this binding here: one object graph serves every installation of the
        artifact digest and is never destroyed per installation.

        There is no active invocation, so Host APIs (storage, config, binding
        lookups) are unavailable. Only process-local state can be touched, and
        only the given `binding` identifies the installation. Return `None`;
        exceptions are logged and never block revocation. The call is serialized
        per installation but may overlap with invocations of sibling
        installations on the same object graph.
